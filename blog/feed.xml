It‚Äôs time to properly meet Fai.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The world of Trip Space</h2>
<p>The concept of Trip Space was originally created as a backdrop for our First-Person Puzzle game, <i>Spectacle</i>. It is a surreal, abstract collection of floating islands and strange vistas that living creatures visit while dreaming, or meditating, or... by other means. Visitors to Trip Space manifest as Peepers (cute little eyeball creatures with wings), they are able to observe this strange world, but they rely on the native Trip Tenders to properly shepherd them through their experience.</p>

<div class="text-center">
<video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/19/BlogPeep.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div>

<p>Living and visiting Trip Space was always tranquil, but the recent invasion of Creepers has turned the experience into a nightmare! An ominous dark fog has engulfed the many islands of Trip Space and it feels impossible to stand against the horde that emerges from it. This is where <i>Tempest Tower</i> takes place.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Who is Fai</h2>
<p>Fai is a Trip Tender, a native inhabitant of Trip Space and a caretaker of the world. Fai is a bit of an underachiever and definitely didn‚Äôt volunteer for the role of hero, they are underprepared and easily distracted, but they are also the only Trip Tender around.</p>

<div class="text-center">

</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Fai is a curious soul, but the Batsplainer is having none of it</span>

<p>With the player‚Äôs help, Fai will become a battle-hardened veteran, and an expert strategist. They will learn to build crazy contraptions as well as use the world of Trip Space against the invasive Creeper forces, and most importantly, they will save the many Peepers who still visit Trip Space.</p>

<div class="text-center">

</div>

<p><b>Fun Fact:</b> We used the name Fai, because it is pronounced similarly to the Danish word Fej, which means coward (and is also close to the word for sweep).</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/19/FaiName.PNG" alt="screenshot of google translate">
</div>

<h2 class="section-heading">Early Concepts</h2>
<p>The native inhabitants of Trip Space being lizard people was an idea that we carried over from <i>Spectacle</i>. We wanted to use the backdrop of Trip Space to embrace the world of conspiracy theories, so the native inhabitants had to be a cult-like group of lizards.</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/19/SpectacleConcept.png" alt="Spectacle Concepts">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Early concepts of Trip Tenders</span>

<p>One of the first mechanics we discussed for <i>Tempest Tower</i> was the ability for our main character to Gust/Push/Waft at objects and enemies in the game. This led to very early concepts of a janitor/caretaker character that used a broom to clean objects and create gusts. We loved the idea of a caretaker character who is forced to go above and beyond to protect their world.</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/19/Cleaning.PNG" alt="sweeping concepts">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">The earliest version of the game had players sweeping up goo for resources.</span>

<p>The idea of the broom becoming a multipurpose tool for building, painting, and digging came a bit later. The broom became such a key part of Fai‚Äôs silhouette that it didn‚Äôt make sense to see them use any other tools. Thankfully, the game is generally a bit goofy, so it doesn‚Äôt feel that strange to see a character digging up a plant with a floppy broom. </p>

<div class="text-center">

<p>Now, drawing a concept and designing a character is one thing but of course we had to translate it to 3D, which is often a lot easier said than done!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">From 2D to 3D</h2>
<p>We were lucky enough to already have a base model to work from. Even though <i>Spectacle</i> was a First-Person game, we did have an ‚Äúout of body‚Äù mechanic that meant we had to model our main character so they could be seen from any angle. This meant we had a place to start, but Fai was very much their own lizard so there was still a lot to do. The yellow rubber gloves really pop alongside Fai‚Äôs purple cloak and the trashcan backpack was just for added bounce and style.</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/19/TheThirdDimention.png" alt="3D turnaround">
</div>

<p>The bouncy animation style is a mix of talented animation work from the HPY team and the Boing Kit plugin for Unity. We gained a lot of experience with expressive movement while working on our previous game, <i>Time on Frog Island</i>, and that did not go to waste here.</p>
<p>To get the perfect look for Fai in game, we are using ramped lighting with a custom ramp texture. We are using an emissive texture to get Fai‚Äôs eyes to glow and applying a matcap texture to enhance the soft lighting. An occlusion map is used, mainly to remove indirect lighting from Fai‚Äôs face so that the hood/cap can look like they are having a bigger impact on the lighting.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Get Involved!</h2>
<p>We will continue to post news and dev-blogs here whenever we have anything big to share and we will be making better use of the Steam Community Hub when we get closer to launch. Until then, the best way to stay informed about all things <i>Tempest Tower</i> is to join us on Discord! We have a few big things coming in the next 2 months and we can‚Äôt wait to hear what you think.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Making the Trailer</h2>
<p>For all those who are interested, I thought I would pull back the curtain a bit on how the trailer was made.</p>
<p>The first look trailer for <i>Tempest Tower</i> was made by James Mcgregor (corfiz.com). We worked with James on most of the <i>Time on Frog Island</i> trailers and really enjoyed the process, so we were ecstatic to find out that he was available to help on <i>Tempest Tower</i> as well.</p>
<p>Having worked with James before, it was pretty easy to get started. I made a trailer brief that outlined the deadline, expected length, links to music from the game, what to show, and what to avoid showing. The brief also included some reference trailers that I thought captured the expected vibe and pace. After that, I created a Trailer Branch that James could work from so that he could easily set up shots and create sets inside the Unity project.</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/18/branches.PNG" alt="showcase of git branches">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Having a trailer branch allowed us to quickly update his working version with bug fixes and new art.</span>

<p>Once James had access to the game, he could spend some time playing and generating ideas before the two of us sat down for a proper meeting about how to best show off the game. James could then get to work on a quick blockout (descriptive text explaining each shot to show the overall timings of the trailer) for the time to give any first notes on.</p>
<p>Most of our notes and discussions were done through Discord or using frame.io, which we could use to give specific feedback on the current version of the trailer. The earliest iteration of the trailer took a bit too long to get to the action, but other than that, the skeleton of the initial blockout held strong through the whole process.</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/18/frameIO.PNG" alt="screenshot from Frame IO">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Notes could be made directly on the timeline, it is also possible to draw on the frame with arrows and circles.</span>

<p>After seeing the first proper cut of the trailer, it was quite clear to the team that our current music selection didn‚Äôt really have anything that matched the trailer‚Äôs energy. The trailer needed to be fast moving (and the game can be hectic too), but nothing we had on hand really fit.</p>
<p>We are lucky enough to have both a full-time composer and a full-time sound designer at Half Past Yellow, so Nino (our composer) made the decision to make something bespoke. It took around 4 days for him to put together a track that properly fit the trailer pace and the experiments have bled back into game music.</p>
<p>Nino's thoughts at that time "<i>Seeing the draft of the trailer made me question the whole musical direction of the game. So, the only reasonable thing to do was to let go the current direction and just vibe with what I have on the screen in front of me. Shortly after, it clicked, and everything started making sense again. The music direction and overall experience of the game had been changed for me. Since then, I have been revisiting the previous tracks I made for the game, sometimes re-doing them from scratch. Whatever it takes for the best experience.</i>"</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/18/Nino_Pic.jpg" alt="Picture of Nino the composer">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Nino during a post music video photoshoot.</span>

<p>Once we had a final trailer edit and music track, it was time to add SFX and balance the audio. Goran (our sound designer) previously worked in film and TV, which is a godsend in situations like this. For the purposes of highlighting specific sounds and properly balancing the SFX and music, it was easier for him to dub over the trailer than worry about using the existing sounds in the clips that James recorded.</p>
<p>I asked Goran to write up some of his thoughts: "<i>The video was action-packed, so finding the right balance between composition and sound design was crucial. The trailer began with a gameplay-driven scene to give a brief glimpse of the world, followed by a gradual buildup into a high-energy trailer sequence. This transition emphasized the core gameplay mechanics while maintaining a strong focus on the sound effects that complemented the music. Since the music was percussive, the percussive elements of the sound design naturally blended in, almost as if they were part of the music itself.</i>"</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/18/Goran_Pic.jpg" alt="Picture of Goran the composer">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Goran inside his home studio.</span>

<p>Balancing the audio is always a friendly fight between Nino and Goran. They both live in the same city, so they met up in person to produce the final audio mix and celebrate the completed trailer.</p>
<p>Eventually, the trailer was complete. We handed off the final audio mix to James along with the art for the end slate and layout mock-ups. From start to finish, I took just under 3 weeks to put everything together and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with the results. I hope that you enjoy this first look at <i>Tempest Tower</i> and that you will keep an eye out for more news about the game and its production!</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that <i>Tempest Tower</i> will be our first self-published game. We plan to launch the game into Steam Early Access during the first half of 2025 and work closely with our community to build a game we are all proud of.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why Early Access?</h2>
<p>For <i>Tempest Tower</i>, we plan to fully embrace the open development style. We want to develop a strong community around the game, and we feel that the best way to do this is by getting players involved early and allowing them to shape the project with us.</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt yet know what the future holds, but we expect <i>Tempest Tower</i> to remain in Early Access for around 9 months. We will use that time to add content, quality of life features, and new game modes. The game will launch on Early Access as a tight experience with all core mechanics present, we aim to have 2-3 hours of base gameplay with endless extra hours of experimenting with loadouts and highscore hunting on top.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting involved right now, I suggest joining our <a href="https://hpy.lol/discord">Discord server</a>. It has been fairly quiet over the last 18 months, but that will be changing as we move into next year!</p>

We have worked alongside another game development studio called <a href="https://bitegginc.com/">BitEgg</a> to update our Capsule Art and we couldn't be happier with the results, they have perfectly captured the vibe of <i>Tempest Tower</i> and we think that the new art really stands out in the Steam store.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is a Level in <i>Tempest Tower</i>?</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs start by quickly outlining what a level in <i>Tempest Tower</i> actually is. Each level is a standalone floating island; the terrain, enemy spawn points, and level segments are all handcrafted by a level designer, but there are some light procedural elements that change after every attempt.</p>
<p>At the start of a level, only a small portion of it is available to explore and build on. The rest of the level is covered in a thick fog. After successfully defending a wave, a section of the fog is pushed back, and a new segment of the level is revealed. Once the last section of the fog has been ousted, the player must defend one last wave in order to complete the level and return to the menu victorious.</p>
<div class="text-center">

</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">An early concept of how levels are revealed incrementally</span>
<p>If the player is overwhelmed by a wave and loses their Main Tower, then they must start the level again. <i>Tempest Tower</i> rewards players who experiment with their loadout and try out different upgrades as they learn the layout of a level and how to deal with different enemies. You never know how things are going to interact.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">WIP map view showing how a level expands.</span> 

<h2 class="section-heading">Learning from <i>Time on Frog Island</i></h2>
<p>An important aspect of the <i>Tempest Tower</i> project is our ability to move quickly with ideas. Because of this, the decision was made early on to use a similar camera angle and movement style to our previous game, <i>Time on Frog Island</i>. Making this decision early allowed us to come into the project with some basic level design rules and a good understanding of how traversal should feel.</p>
<p><i>Time on Frog Island</i> sees the player doing a lot of running around so it was important to us that the act of traversing the island was as fun as possible (even when lost and slightly frustrated).</p>

<p>
<b>Key level design tenets from <i>ToFI</i>:</b>
<ul>
  <li> The island gains height/verticality the further ‚Äònorth‚Äô that the player travels 
  <li> All designed/expected jumps in the game are possible with about 1 meter of leeway (the game is not built to be a hardcore platformer)
  <li> It is always clear when the player needs to jump (exposed rock visuals) 
  <li> The camera angle makes height differences in the geometry are difficult to parse so take off points for ‚Äò1-way jumps‚Äô should be marked clearly
  <li> If the player is ever completely obscured by terrain (which was used sparingly), the ground should be completely smooth and require no jumps to pass through  
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Blockouting a level for <i>Tempest Tower</i></h2>
<p>While we are lucky to be starting with so much knowledge from <i>Time on Frog Island</i>, it was still necessary to find the fun within <i>Tempest Tower</i>. The rules above gave us a good place to start, but we had to be fast at creating new levels so we could properly test different gameplay features. Blockouting a level always went through three stages of focus; player movement, enemy paths, gameplay objects/items.</p>
<p>The base terrain is built up by connecting and overlapping pre-built platform pieces in order to create flat open areas, terraced hillsides, and connecting slopes. Pre-built rock shapes are used to plug holes, block jumps, and add visual variety to the space. We are using a world space triplanar shader for both the ground material as well as the exposed rock material so that we can guarantee that the terrain textures always line up. This does generate quite a bit of overlapping geometry, which we might need to revisit at a later date, but it isn‚Äôt currently a performance problem.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/LevelPieces.png" alt="Level Pieces">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Some of the many standardised level pieces we have for making levels.</span>
<p>Enemies cannot jump or drop off ledges, so platforming areas act as shortcuts between different sections of the level. We always build levels with a player movement focus first as it has the largest impact on the fun factor of a level. Levels can often feel a little bare at this point (see: the embedded tweet at the top of this post), but understanding how the player moves around a level is important to understand before moving onto the next step.</p>
<p>Once we have a good first pass on the overall level, the focus shifts to building enemy paths. A level in <i>Tempest Tower</i> needs to feel amazing (and ideally different) to traverse while empty as well as when it is filled with enemies. The route(s) that enemies take through the level can greatly affect the flow of the space, tight corridors become impassable while high cliffs can be more easily reached. Because of this, we are still making big changes to the base terrain while we decide how to weave enemy paths through it.</p>
<p>The final piece of the blockouting puzzle is the setup of game objects and items. These are gameplay relevant elements that the player can interact with and use during the level, (things like resource spawners, bombs, destructible blockers, etc.). Once added, the level is properly playable, and the designer can start to evaluate, refine and balance (which is where the real fun begins).</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Level blockout timelapse.</span> 

<h2 class="section-heading">Early experimentation</h2>
<p>An action-packed Tower Defence with Platforming elements. This was the key one-liner that drove our early experimentation. We wanted to reward movement efficiency, smart planning, and the ability to react quickly when things go wrong.</p>
<p>The first iteration of <i>Tempest Tower</i> focused too much on movement. After setting up some defences and starting the wave, the player was expected to effectively ignore enemies in their mad dash for resource collection. This allowed us to create levels that were more vertical and maze like, but it felt counter intuitive to testers (they wanted to engage more with the enemies).</p>
<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/EarlyLevelBlockout2.png" alt="Early Blockout">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Our first full level blockout for pitching at GDC.</span>
<p>In this early stage of development, the player collected the gold/ore/currency for building new defences by clearing away gunk from specific spawner locations. Because of this, the design of early levels used a lot more verticality, included more jumps, and had more gaps in the terrain. The game design also placed the most emphasis on route planning and execution so levels had more of a racetrack feel, packed with side paths, slopes, and shortcuts that were devoid of enemies/threats.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/MarchBlockoutFootage.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Running around an early level blockout.</span> 
<p>
<b>While testing this version of the game, 3 key things were clear:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Players didn‚Äôt have an overview of how their defences were working 
  <li> The resource collection was so vastly different from the genre norms of Tower Defence games that players often just forgot to seek resource spawners out
  <li> It was a lot of fun to interact with enemies and players generally gravitated towards pushing them around and stomping on them
</ul>
</p>
<p>We are still making progress on the first point. UI and map updates are helping with player overview, but there is still more to be done. We decided to focus on bringing resource collection more in line with genre norms as that would impact points two and three.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/OreConcept.png" alt="Currency Collection Concept">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Concept art showing how currency was originally collected by the player.</span>

<h2 class="section-heading">Big feature changes</h2>
<p>We knew that the right way to reward the player with currency was by having them eliminate enemies. This is too much of a genre staple to mess around with (anymore). However, it was important that we still reward movement efficiency as well as give the player a reason to interact with enemies as much as possible (turning what‚Äôs fun into what must be done)!</p>
<p>We tried a few different ideas for this; gaining currency by clearing enemy corpses, gaining currency by last hitting enemies, etc. In the end we ended up with a new game object that would be placed around the level, the Shrine.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/ShrineAbsorb.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Shrines absorb enemy souls.</span> 
<p>Any enemies killed within range of a Shrine will have its soul absorbed. The Shrine holds enemy souls like a piggy bank, and when the player needs to build more defences they must break the piggy bank to acquire the souls. A broken Shrine will no longer absorb enemy souls, so players are forced to build new nests of turrets further away from the Main Tower.</p>
<p>We are still figuring out how to properly tutorialise the feature, but players have reacted positively to the change so far. They are excited to engage with enemies as well as venture out further into the map to build at advantageous points. Min-maxing a Shrine‚Äôs soul collection, making strategic decisions about when to acquire the souls, and pushing/zoning enemies to keep them in range have all made the game more fun and replayable.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/ShrineCollect.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Obtaining the collected souls means destroying the Shrine.</span> 
<p>On top of this, enemies killed outside the range of a Shrine spawn a soul that lingers on the map for a short amount of time. Players can grab these souls out of the air as they move around the level rewarding player movement efficiency with additional currency.</p>
<p>This was a bonus feature that ‚Äòjust made sense‚Äô to add alongside the shrine functionality. It aligned perfectly with how we wanted players to engage with the game and understanding the idea of ‚Äòlingering souls‚Äô came quickly.</p>
<div class="text-center">

</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Jumping to catch the 'lingering souls' of enemies killed outside Shrine range.</span> 

<h2 class="section-heading">Impacts to level design</h2>
<p>The introduction of Shrines has caused the levels we are designing to flatten out. Enemy paths weave and curve more so that players have an easier time taking advantage of Shrine range. Levels have more flat open space and a lot less gaps in the terrain to give players more building options with their turrets. Ultimately, the levels have started to look a lot more like a traditional Tower Defence when you look at the entire map from above (seems like a good direction).</p>

</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">An exmaple of a level designed after we implemented the Shrine feature.</span>
<p>We are still experimenting with level design procedures at the moment. It is important for us to understand what makes a level of <i>Tempest Tower</i> fun so that we can reliably produce great levels at a reasonable pace. There is probably another blog post in here about ‚Äòcharacter movement test level(s)‚Äô and how they inform our design rules... But that's for another time.</p>

<p>As hinted at in our <a href="/blog/2024/06/10/HPY-Update.html">last post</a>, we've been quite busy this year and are excited to announce our next project, <i>Tempest Tower</i>! It is an action-packed Tower Defence game with Platforming elements. We are bringing the much-loved character feel and animation style of <i>Time on Frog Island</i> to a new type of game. You will have to dodge and weave through waves of Creepers while maintaining your defences and herding the local critters to safety.</p>
<p>If that sounds like your kind of game, then I have good news for you! You can wishlist the game on Steam right now and get notified when the game launches.</p>

<div class="text-center"><iframe src="https://store.steampowered.com/widget/3123800/" frameborder="0" width="646" height="190"></iframe></div>

<h2 class="section-heading">A Tower Defence with Platforming elements?</h2>
<p>The perfect mix of strategy and action. <i>Tempest Tower</i> offers traditional Tower Defense base building and wave-based gameplay with an added layer of player interaction. Push enemies around, personally activate traps, and jump on enemy heads while you save critters and collect resources.</p>
<p>Our goal for this project is to add a new level of tension to the Tower Defence genre by placing the player right in the middle of the action. You will have unlimited time to structure your defences and plan. When you activate the wave, you must trust your defences while you dodge, push, and stomp your way through hordes of enemies to collect resources and save cute little eyeball creatures called Peepers.</p>

<div class="text-center">

</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">These cute little guys can't defend themselves</span> 

<h2 class="section-heading">Push back the horde and claim victory</h2>
<p>My favorite mechanic is related to how we have structured the levels in <i>Tempest Tower</i>. At the start of a level, only a small portion of it will be available to explore. The rest of the level is covered in a thick fog. After successfully defending a wave, you will push back part of the fog and reveal a new section of the level.</p>
<p>Once you dispel the last of the fog, you will have one last wave of enemies to deal with before you claim victory on that map.</p>
<p>Pushing back the fog means pushing back enemy spawn points and gaining access to new strategic locations, but the Creepers will soon be back, and in greater numbers!</p>

</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">A concept of the fog mechanic</span>

<p>This structure makes designing levels a really interesting challenge. We have spent a lot of time figuring out the right size of level, how much to reveal per wave, what tools the player needs to make traversal exciting, and so much more. Stay tuned for an in-depth level design blog later in the year üòâ</p>

<p>The game development industry has been having a hard time over the last year and a half. Studio closers, layoffs, and cancelled projects are a normal part of the news cycle now and it is difficult to tell when the bleeding will stop.</p>
<p>Half Past Yellow had to say goodbye to 2 of our team members in May due to uncertainty with project financing. The team members of HPY are the most valuable asset the studio has, and it feels terrible to lose key parts of it.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The struggle to secure funding</h2>
<p>Half Past Yellow started working on <i>Spectacle</i> in late 2022 and we have been showing off the game to potential publishers and investors as early as March 2023. It was already clear that the landscape for funding new projects was difficult to traverse, but we were optimistic that we would find a passionate publisher for the project by the end of the year. We persisted with the project, but as the year came to an end, it was clear that we weren‚Äôt getting the interest we hoped for. Most publishers cited similar concerns about the puzzle genre, specifically noting the ratio of ‚Äòdevelopment cost‚Äô to ‚Äòplayable hours‚Äô as a difficult investment to justify in the current market.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2024, we decided to start prototyping new games that had a stronger focus on action and replayability (a better ratio of ‚Äòdevelopment cost‚Äô and ‚Äòplayable hours‚Äô). We already had a commercially viable demo as well as a showcase build with more complicated puzzles, so it was possible to work on something new while seeking investment in Spectacle. In the past 6 months, we haven‚Äôt made any breakthroughs with Spectacle, but we have seen some early interest in our new project.</p>
<p>We believe that <i>Spectacle</i> requires an additional 12-18 months of development and this isn‚Äôt something that Half Past Yellow can commit to without the financial backing of a publisher or investment partner. Because of this, we have made the difficult decision to fully switch projects.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is happening with Spectacle?</h2>
<p>We were so excited to release the <i>Spectacle</i> demo and we are ecstatic that players enjoyed the game. The demo was released to show off the game that we have been diligently working on over the course of 2023 as well as give us some concrete information about player interest in a full game.</p>
<p>It was impossible for us to back up the demo launch with a proper marketing push, so we had to rely on word of mouth and Steam‚Äôs algorithm to be noticed. <i>Spectacle</i> saw good traction in the smaller Cerebral Puzzle Showcase but failed to get any real interest during Next Fest.</p>

<p>
Wow, it has been a year and a half since our last blog post. Our biggest gap yet üõπ </p>
<p>A lot has happened in that time, and we are excited to update you with this blog post and one coming next month. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Witness a <i>Spectacle</i>!</h2>
<p>
Last year we announced our next game, <i>Spectacle</i>. A surreal first-person puzzle game about observation, spatial reasoning, and lizards. The core mechanics of <i>Spectacle</i> revolve around blinking, winking, and wearing special glasses that transform how you interact with the world.

You get to play the tutorial sequence, and at the end, you will get a sneak peek of the ‚Äòfirst proper level‚Äô of the full game. Take control of Glo, a newly hatched lizard who learns about the world of Trip Space while you explore the surreal world of <i>Spectacle</i> and engage with its puzzles.

<h2 class="section-heading">A new way to perceive puzzles</h2>

<p>
<i>Spectacle</i> offers a novel puzzle solving experience with unique mechanics and controls. The game began life as an exploration of tele-rotating the player in 3D space with a ‚Äúmatch cut‚Äù and continued to grow from there.  
</P>

</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Same, same...</span> 

<p>
A lot has changed since then and I‚Äôm so happy to finally be sharing Spectacle publicly. I hope that players have as much fun playing it as we did making it.

<p>
Games take a monumental amount of time and effort to develop, and releasing is a scary moment for any studio. The community response to the game is everything we hoped for and more, seeing players enjoy their time on Frog Island has been so rewarding for us, and hearing fun stories from friends and fans never gets old. We hope this is just the first of many Half Past Yellow adventures that fans enjoy.

<h2 class="section-heading">Patched up and ready to go</h2>

<p>
As of mid-November, our first bug-fixing patch for <i>Time on Frog Island</i> was released across all platforms. It took a while to make it onto consoles due to some logistical issues on our side, but everything is up and running now with everyone on the same version of the game. 
</P>

<p>
The patch fixes a few niggling bugs seen around the island, plus some bigger bugs associated with The Merchant and The Blacksmith schedules not being properly updated. We have also fixed a bug blocking some players from getting the Frogs Legs, Sea Legs, and Yeet trophies/achievements (sorry about that trophy hunters).

<h2 class="section-heading">Time on Frog Island OST now available!</h2>
<p>
It is now possible to take our cosy island vibes with you wherever you go! The <i>Time on Frog Island</i> soundtrack is now available for purchase on Steam. We don‚Äôt have a timeline yet, but we would like to bring the OST to other platforms (such as Spotify) as well. Let us know which ones you use! We will keep you posted on that progress. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is next for Half Past Yellow?</h2>

<p>
At Half Past Yellow, we are consistently curious about different genres and technology. We will always bring the same HPY charm and style to all of our games, but each project will be different to the one that came before. We are really excited for 2023, production has already begun on our next project and we can‚Äôt wait until we get to show it off. Until then you will just have to keep your eyes peeled! üëÅÔ∏è
