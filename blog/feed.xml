<h2 class="section-heading">What is a Level in <i>Tempest Tower</i>?</h2>
<p>Let’s start by quickly outlining what a level in <i>Tempest Tower</i> actually is. Each level is a standalone floating island; the terrain, enemy spawn points, and level segments are all handcrafted by a level designer, but there are some light procedural elements that change after every attempt.</p>
<p>At the start of a level, only a small portion of it is available to explore and build on. The rest of the level is covered in a thick fog. After successfully defending a wave, a section of the fog is pushed back, and a new segment of the level is revealed. Once the last section of the fog has been ousted, the player must defend one last wave in order to complete the level and return to the menu victorious.</p>

</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">An early concept of how levels are revealed incrementally</span>
<p>If the player is overwhelmed by a wave and loses their Main Tower, then they must start the level again. <i>Tempest Tower</i> rewards players who experiment with their loadout and try out different upgrades as they learn the layout of a level and how to deal with different enemies. You never know how things are going to interact.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Learning from <i>Time on Frog Island</i></h2>
<p>An important aspect of the <i>Tempest Tower</i> project is our ability to move quickly with ideas. Because of this, the decision was made early on to use a similar camera angle and movement style to our previous game, <i>Time on Frog Island</i>. Making this decision early allowed us to come into the project with some basic level design rules and a good understanding of how traversal should feel.</p>
<p><i>Time on Frog Island</i> sees the player doing a lot of running around so it was important to us that the act of traversing the island was as fun as possible (even when lost and slightly frustrated).</p>
<div class="text-center">
<video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/ToFIExplore.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">A quick loop around Frog Island at 250% speed!</span> 
<p>
<b>Key level design tenets from <i>ToFI</i>:</b>
<ul>
  <li> The island gains height/verticality the further ‘north’ that the player travels 
  <li> All designed/expected jumps in the game are possible with about 1 meter of leeway (the game is not built to be a hardcore platformer)
  <li> It is always clear when the player needs to jump (exposed rock visuals) 
  <li> The camera angle makes height differences in the geometry are difficult to parse so take off points for ‘1-way jumps’ should be marked clearly
  <li> If the player is ever completely obscured by terrain (which was used sparingly), the ground should be completely smooth and require no jumps to pass through  
</ul>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Blockouting a level for <i>Tempest Tower</i></h2>
<p>While we are lucky to be starting with so much knowledge from <i>Time on Frog Island</i>, it was still necessary to find the fun within <i>Tempest Tower</i>. The rules above gave us a good place to start, but we had to be fast at creating new levels so we could properly test different gameplay features. Blockouting a level always went through three stages of focus; player movement, enemy paths, gameplay objects/items.</p>
<p>The base terrain is built up by connecting and overlapping pre-built platform pieces in order to create flat open areas, terraced hillsides, and connecting slopes. Pre-built rock shapes are used to plug holes, block jumps, and add visual variety to the space. We are using a world space triplanar shader for both the ground material as well as the exposed rock material so that we can guarantee that the terrain textures always line up. This does generate quite a bit of overlapping geometry, which we might need to revisit at a later date, but it isn’t currently a performance problem.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/LevelPieces.png" alt="Level Pieces">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Some of the many standardised level pieces we have for making levels.</span>
<p>Enemies cannot jump or drop off ledges, so platforming areas act as shortcuts between different sections of the level. We always build levels with a player movement focus first as it has the largest impact on the fun factor of a level. Levels can often feel a little bare at this point (see: the embedded tweet at the top of this post), but understanding how the player moves around a level is important to understand before moving onto the next step.</p>
<p>Once we have a good first pass on the overall level, the focus shifts to building enemy paths. A level in <i>Tempest Tower</i> needs to feel amazing (and ideally different) to traverse while empty as well as when it is filled with enemies. The route(s) that enemies take through the level can greatly affect the flow of the space, tight corridors become impassable while high cliffs can be more easily reached. Because of this, we are still making big changes to the base terrain while we decide how to weave enemy paths through it.</p>
<p>The final piece of the blockouting puzzle is the setup of game objects and items. These are gameplay relevant elements that the player can interact with and use during the level, (things like resource spawners, bombs, destructible blockers, etc.). Once added, the level is properly playable, and the designer can start to evaluate, refine and balance (which is where the real fun begins).</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Level blockout timelapse.</span> 

<h2 class="section-heading">Early experimentation</h2>
<p>An action-packed Tower Defence with Platforming elements. This was the key one-liner that drove our early experimentation. We wanted to reward movement efficiency, smart planning, and the ability to react quickly when things go wrong.</p>
<p>The first iteration of <i>Tempest Tower</i> focused too much on movement. After setting up some defences and starting the wave, the player was expected to effectively ignore enemies in their mad dash for resource collection. This allowed us to create levels that were more vertical and maze like, but it felt counter intuitive to testers (they wanted to engage more with the enemies).</p>
<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/EarlyLevelBlockout.png" alt="Early Blockout">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Our first full level blockout for pitching at GDC.</span>
<p>In this early stage of development, the player collected the gold/ore/currency for building new defences by clearing away gunk from specific spawner locations. Because of this, the design of early levels used a lot more verticality, included more jumps, and had more gaps in the terrain. The game design also placed the most emphasis on route planning and execution so levels had more of a racetrack feel, packed with side paths, slopes, and shortcuts that were devoid of enemies/threats.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/MarchBlockoutFootage.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Running around an early level blockout.</span> 
<p>
<b>While testing this version of the game, 3 key things were clear:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Players didn’t have an overview of how their defences were working 
  <li> The resource collection was so vastly different from the genre norms of Tower Defence games that players often just forgot to seek resource spawners out
  <li> It was a lot of fun to interact with enemies and players generally gravitated towards pushing them around and stomping on them
</ul>
</p>
<p>We are still making progress on the first point. UI and map updates are helping with player overview, but there is still more to be done. We decided to focus on bringing resource collection more in line with genre norms as that would impact points two and three.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" style="max-width:60%" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/OreConcept.png" alt="Currency Collection Concept">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Concept art showing how currency was originally collected by the player.</span>

<h2 class="section-heading">Big feature changes</h2>
<p>We knew that the right way to reward the player with currency was by having them eliminate enemies. This is too much of a genre staple to mess around with (anymore). However, it was important that we still reward movement efficiency as well as give the player a reason to interact with enemies as much as possible (turning what’s fun into what must be done)!</p>
<p>We tried a few different ideas for this; gaining currency by clearing enemy corpses, gaining currency by last hitting enemies, etc. In the end we ended up with a new game object that would be placed around the level, the Shrine.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/ShrineAbsorb.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Shrines absorb enemy souls.</span> 
<p>Any enemies killed within range of a Shrine will have its soul absorbed. The Shrine holds enemy souls like a piggy bank, and when the player needs to build more defences they must break the piggy bank to acquire the souls. A broken Shrine will no longer absorb enemy souls, so players are forced to build new nests of turrets further away from the Main Tower.</p>
<p>We are still figuring out how to properly tutorialise the feature, but players have reacted positively to the change so far. They are excited to engage with enemies as well as venture out further into the map to build at advantageous points. Min-maxing a Shrine’s soul collection, making strategic decisions about when to acquire the souls, and pushing/zoning enemies to keep them in range have all made the game more fun and replayable.</p>
<div class="text-center">
<video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/16/ShrineCollect.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Obtaining the collected souls means destroying the Shrine.</span> 
<p>On top of this, enemies killed outside the range of a Shrine spawn a soul that lingers on the map for a short amount of time. Players can grab these souls out of the air as they move around the level rewarding player movement efficiency with additional currency.</p>
<p>This was a bonus feature that ‘just made sense’ to add alongside the shrine functionality. It aligned perfectly with how we wanted players to engage with the game and understanding the idea of ‘lingering souls’ came quickly.</p>
<div class="text-center">

</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Jumping to catch the 'lingering souls' of enemies killed outside Shrine range.</span> 

<h2 class="section-heading">Impacts to level design</h2>
<p>The introduction of Shrines has caused the levels we are designing to flatten out. Enemy paths weave and curve more so that players have an easier time taking advantage of Shrine range. Levels have more flat open space and a lot less gaps in the terrain to give players more building options with their turrets. Ultimately, the levels have started to look a lot more like a traditional Tower Defence when you look at the entire map from above (seems like a good direction).</p>

</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">An exmaple of a level designed after we implemented the Shrine feature.</span>
<p>We are still experimenting with level design procedures at the moment. It is important for us to understand what makes a level of <i>Tempest Tower</i> fun so that we can reliably produce great levels at a reasonable pace. There is probably another blog post in here about ‘character movement test level(s)’ and how they inform our design rules... But that's for another time.</p>

<p>As hinted at in our <a href="/blog/2024/06/10/HPY-Update.html">last post</a>, we've been quite busy this year and are excited to announce our next project, <i>Tempest Tower</i>! It is an action-packed Tower Defence game with Platforming elements. We are bringing the much-loved character feel and animation style of <i>Time on Frog Island</i> to a new type of game. You will have to dodge and weave through waves of Creepers while maintaining your defences and herding the local critters to safety.</p>
<p>If that sounds like your kind of game, then I have good news for you! You can wishlist the game on Steam right now and get notified when the game launches.</p>

<div class="text-center"><iframe src="https://store.steampowered.com/widget/3123800/" frameborder="0" width="646" height="190"></iframe></div>

<h2 class="section-heading">A Tower Defence with Platforming elements?</h2>
<p>The perfect mix of strategy and action. <i>Tempest Tower</i> offers traditional Tower Defense base building and wave-based gameplay with an added layer of player interaction. Push enemies around, personally activate traps, and jump on enemy heads while you save critters and collect resources.</p>
<p>Our goal for this project is to add a new level of tension to the Tower Defence genre by placing the player right in the middle of the action. You will have unlimited time to structure your defences and plan. When you activate the wave, you must trust your defences while you dodge, push, and stomp your way through hordes of enemies to collect resources and save cute little eyeball creatures called Peepers.</p>

<div class="text-center">

</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">These cute little guys can't defend themselves</span> 

<h2 class="section-heading">Push back the horde and claim victory</h2>
<p>My favorite mechanic is related to how we have structured the levels in <i>Tempest Tower</i>. At the start of a level, only a small portion of it will be available to explore. The rest of the level is covered in a thick fog. After successfully defending a wave, you will push back part of the fog and reveal a new section of the level.</p>
<p>Once you dispel the last of the fog, you will have one last wave of enemies to deal with before you claim victory on that map.</p>
<p>Pushing back the fog means pushing back enemy spawn points and gaining access to new strategic locations, but the Creepers will soon be back, and in greater numbers!</p>

</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">A concept of the fog mechanic</span>

<p>This structure makes designing levels a really interesting challenge. We have spent a lot of time figuring out the right size of level, how much to reveal per wave, what tools the player needs to make traversal exciting, and so much more. Stay tuned for an in-depth level design blog later in the year 😉</p>

<p>The game development industry has been having a hard time over the last year and a half. Studio closers, layoffs, and cancelled projects are a normal part of the news cycle now and it is difficult to tell when the bleeding will stop.</p>
<p>Half Past Yellow had to say goodbye to 2 of our team members in May due to uncertainty with project financing. The team members of HPY are the most valuable asset the studio has, and it feels terrible to lose key parts of it.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The struggle to secure funding</h2>
<p>Half Past Yellow started working on <i>Spectacle</i> in late 2022 and we have been showing off the game to potential publishers and investors as early as March 2023. It was already clear that the landscape for funding new projects was difficult to traverse, but we were optimistic that we would find a passionate publisher for the project by the end of the year. We persisted with the project, but as the year came to an end, it was clear that we weren’t getting the interest we hoped for. Most publishers cited similar concerns about the puzzle genre, specifically noting the ratio of ‘development cost’ to ‘playable hours’ as a difficult investment to justify in the current market.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2024, we decided to start prototyping new games that had a stronger focus on action and replayability (a better ratio of ‘development cost’ and ‘playable hours’). We already had a commercially viable demo as well as a showcase build with more complicated puzzles, so it was possible to work on something new while seeking investment in Spectacle. In the past 6 months, we haven’t made any breakthroughs with Spectacle, but we have seen some early interest in our new project.</p>
<p>We believe that <i>Spectacle</i> requires an additional 12-18 months of development and this isn’t something that Half Past Yellow can commit to without the financial backing of a publisher or investment partner. Because of this, we have made the difficult decision to fully switch projects.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is happening with Spectacle?</h2>
<p>We were so excited to release the <i>Spectacle</i> demo and we are ecstatic that players enjoyed the game. The demo was released to show off the game that we have been diligently working on over the course of 2023 as well as give us some concrete information about player interest in a full game.</p>
<p>It was impossible for us to back up the demo launch with a proper marketing push, so we had to rely on word of mouth and Steam’s algorithm to be noticed. <i>Spectacle</i> saw good traction in the smaller Cerebral Puzzle Showcase but failed to get any real interest during Next Fest.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">We saw a good bump in wishlists during puzzle fest, but not enough to change our fate</span>

<p>The <i>Spectacle</i> demo will remain available on Steam forever and we are excited by the prospect of returning to the project one day, but the internal status is currently: delayed indefinitely.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What does the future hold?</h2>
<p>The team is ready to show off the project that we started prototyping at the beginning of this year. We will be sharing gameplay footage on our <a href="http://hpy.lol/discord">Discord</a>, <a href="https://x.com/halfpastyellow">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HalfPastYellow">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/halfpastyellow_/">Instagram</a> over the next 4-6 weeks as we build up to a proper announcement and Steam page launch. I hope you take the time to check it out and let us know what you think. In the meantime, a sneak peak will have to do.</p>

<p>
Wow, it has been a year and a half since our last blog post. Our biggest gap yet 🛹 </p>
<p>A lot has happened in that time, and we are excited to update you with this blog post and one coming next month. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Witness a <i>Spectacle</i>!</h2>
<p>
Last year we announced our next game, <i>Spectacle</i>. A surreal first-person puzzle game about observation, spatial reasoning, and lizards. The core mechanics of <i>Spectacle</i> revolve around blinking, winking, and wearing special glasses that transform how you interact with the world. 
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Enter the surreal and mind-bending world of <i>Spectacle</i> – a new first-person puzzle game 👁<br>We can finally reveal the game we’ve been working on and look forward to hearing what you think!

<h2 class="section-heading">Play Today!</h2>
<p>
We are happy to announce that you can play a demo version of <i>Spectacle</i> TODAY! We have been selected to show <i>Spectacle</i> alongside many other great puzzle games during the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/CerebralPuzzleShowcase">Cerebral Puzzle Showcase</a> presented by <a href="https://www.draknek.org/">Draknek & Friends</a>. </p>

<p>
The event runs from <b> May 23rd until May 30th</b>, don't miss it!
</p>

<div class="text-center"><iframe src="https://store.steampowered.com/widget/2996710/" frameborder="0" width="646" height="190"></iframe></div>

<p>
You get to play the tutorial sequence, and at the end, you will get a sneak peek of the ‘first proper level’ of the full game. Take control of Glo, a newly hatched lizard who learns about the world of Trip Space while you explore the surreal world of <i>Spectacle</i> and engage with its puzzles.

<span class="caption text-muted">An early concept of the main character, Glo.</span> 


<h2 class="section-heading">A new way to perceive puzzles</h2>

<p>
<i>Spectacle</i> offers a novel puzzle solving experience with unique mechanics and controls. The game began life as an exploration of tele-rotating the player in 3D space with a “match cut” and continued to grow from there.

</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Same, same...</span> 

<p>
A lot has changed since then and I’m so happy to finally be sharing Spectacle publicly. I hope that players have as much fun playing it as we did making it.

The HPY Discord is slowly growing. If you aren’t already a member of our little community, we would love to have you join and share your experiences with the <i>Spectacle</i> Demo.

<p>
Games take a monumental amount of time and effort to develop, and releasing is a scary moment for any studio. The community response to the game is everything we hoped for and more, seeing players enjoy their time on Frog Island has been so rewarding for us, and hearing fun stories from friends and fans never gets old. We hope this is just the first of many Half Past Yellow adventures that fans enjoy.

<h2 class="section-heading">Patched up and ready to go</h2>

<p>
As of mid-November, our first bug-fixing patch for <i>Time on Frog Island</i> was released across all platforms. It took a while to make it onto consoles due to some logistical issues on our side, but everything is up and running now with everyone on the same version of the game. 
</P>

<p>
The patch fixes a few niggling bugs seen around the island, plus some bigger bugs associated with The Merchant and The Blacksmith schedules not being properly updated. We have also fixed a bug blocking some players from getting the Frogs Legs, Sea Legs, and Yeet trophies/achievements (sorry about that trophy hunters).

<h2 class="section-heading">Time on Frog Island OST now available!</h2>
<p>
It is now possible to take our cosy island vibes with you wherever you go! The <i>Time on Frog Island</i> soundtrack is now available for purchase on Steam. We don’t have a timeline yet, but we would like to bring the OST to other platforms (such as Spotify) as well. Let us know which ones you use! We will keep you posted on that progress. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is next for Half Past Yellow?</h2>

<p>
At Half Past Yellow, we are consistently curious about different genres and technology. We will always bring the same HPY charm and style to all of our games, but each project will be different to the one that came before. We are really excited for 2023, production has already begun on our next project and we can’t wait until we get to show it off. Until then you will just have to keep your eyes peeled! 👁️

<p>
A lot has happened since the last post on this regularly irregular blog so there's quite a few things to go over! First up, we have a new name: <b><i>Time on Frog Island</i></b>!
</p>

<div class="text-center">
  <video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/9/NameReveal.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">New year, new me!</span> 

<p>
</p>

<p>
We updated the name to make it easier to search for the game and not get swamped by financial and sports news. It's a little bittersweet since we grew quite fond of the name <i>Trading Time</i> and are sad to see it go. Other potential contenders were: <i>'Beyond the Pond'</i>, <i>'Gaffed Mast'</i>, <i>'Barter Buddies'</i>, <i>'Hey Yo, What's That Item? Can You Get It For Me?'</i> and many others! Did we make the right choice? Only (<s>Trading</s>) time (on Frog Island) will tell!
</P>

<h2 class="section-heading">New Trailer!</h2>

<p>
Next up, we released another trailer showcasing even more of the island and the various frog folk you'll encounter set to our own spin on a catchy, familiar tune:
</p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 rounded">

<p>
Did you spot the <i>secret crabs</i> littered around the island? There's one hidden in almost every shot. How many can you find? Let us know on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/8TkpjHHVzZ">Discord</a>!
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">New Release Date!</h2>
<p>
And now for the release date reveal, get your calendar marking pen ready and peep the announcement trailer below:

<p>
<i>Time on Frog Island</i> will release on <b>July 12th</b> for PC and all major consoles! Not only that - we're very excited to also have <i>ToFI</i> available as...
</p>

<h2>Physical Copies!</h2>

<p>
For the collectors amongst us, <i>Time on Frog Island</i> will also be available in physical editions for your favourite console! You might be able to find it in your local game shops but you can also preorder with our partners at Signature Edition games <a href="https://signatureeditiongames.com/search?type=product&options%5Bprefix%5D=last&q=time+on+frog+island">here</a>!

<h2 class="section-heading">Same Prologue!</h2>
<p>
For a limited time only as of this writing, we have not yet updated the title screen to <i>Time on Frog Island</i> in the Prologue on Steam! Invest in yourself and play the <b>free</b> Prologue now if you haven't already. Once it's updated, you'll be able to tell everyone "I played it when it was still called <i>Trading Time</i>!" and acrue a couple shiny <i>hipster points</i>! If you're reading this after we've updated it, then sadly you're too late! But for real we would still love it if you checked it out and also leave a review...

<p>
<i>Phew</i>, big update! It's exciting times for us over at Half Past Yellow and we can't wait to have you all play our game!

Hi! My name is Mikkel! I’m a Marketing Intern here at Half Past Yellow on behalf of Copenhagen Business Academy in Denmark. I’m here until April! I’m natively Danish but speak fluent English.  
</p>

<p>
I’m hijacking the blog from Remy today! :D
</p>

<p>
First of all, welcome to all our new followers! We had a bit of a viral post last Wednesday and that sure does warm my little marketing heart! <3 If it’s your first time with us here, be sure to also check out the previous blog posts!

Although I could ramble about marketing and SoMe presence, that is not the topic of today.
</p>

<p>
Today I want to write a little about our process in a country that is generally shut down. As you may or may not know, our studio is based in Copenhagen and that Denmark has closed most public places due to COVID-19. This means that we have been working home. I want to share a little bit about what our working process looks like these days. 
</P>

Essentially, our office exists on a Discord server. An open virtual office environment as we call it. The way it works is that we have a meeting every morning, so we still have some daily structure. We then move on to our tasks and work by ourselves. The perk of using Discord is that we can have a call open, which gives us the option of just unmuting when we need to address something or have something off topic to say. It helps create a close to real office environment. There are also other channels we can pop off to for private conversations or meetings.
</P>

<p>
In a real office environment you’ll also have small talk and banter. From what I can read from my peers online, a lot of companies face issues with not being able to recreate this in a virtual environment  This is especially challenging because it’s something you can’t really force. We chose to fight this problem by having different channels for different subjects.

<span class="caption text-muted">Super secret dev channels!</span> 

<p>
We have #devrandom where we can post random stuff we find online, which often sparks spontaneous conversation. Of course it's not the same as being together in person, but it’s real close! 
</P>

<p>
These channels are private to us Developers, but our Discord server is public for anyone who wants to be part of our community! You can <a href="https://discord.com/invite/8TkpjHHVzZ">join us here</a>! We really enjoy hearing about any feedback and thoughts you might have about us or our games, so don’t be shy! You’ll also know about the occasional scoop that we don’t post anywhere else...

All in all, it is a weird time to work, which we are sure you all know. In any case we do wish you all the best and stay safe! Make sure you <a href="https://discord.com/invite/8TkpjHHVzZ">tune in </a> for further updates on the game!
