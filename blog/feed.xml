<p>I want to thank everyone who took the time to check out the <i>Spectacle</i> Demo during the Cerebral Puzzle Fest. We received some great feedback via the Steam community hub and our Discord.</p>
<p>The <i>Spectacle</i> demo will be available again today as part of Steam Next Fest. After the event, we will keep the demo available forever. We are so excited to see <i>Spectacle</i> reach a wider audience.</p>

<p><i>Steam Next Fest</i> runs from <b>June 10th until June 17th</b> but the demo is forever!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The world of Trip Space</h2>
<p>Eagle-eyed players will have seen small eyeball creatures (Peepers) running around. These creatures are visitors to Trip Space, excited to see all the strange sights. Peepers will be both a help and a hindrance during your journey.</p>

</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">A concept of the Peepers with Glo</span>

<p>We designed Peepers to inject charm into the game. <i>Spectacle</i> will only include a few lizard characters and we thought it was important that the game didn't feel too lonely to explore. We carefully crafted the colour, size, sounds, and animation to create the cutest little things we could.</p>
<p>Judging by tester feedback, I think we succeeded in our goal.</p>

<p>
Wow, it has been a year and a half since our last blog post. Our biggest gap yet üõπ </p>
<p>A lot has happened in that time, and we are excited to update you with this blog post and one coming next month. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Witness a <i>Spectacle</i>!</h2>
<p>
Last year we announced our next game, <i>Spectacle</i>. A surreal first-person puzzle game about observation, spatial reasoning, and lizards. The core mechanics of <i>Spectacle</i> revolve around blinking, winking, and wearing special glasses that transform how you interact with the world. 
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Enter the surreal and mind-bending world of <i>Spectacle</i> ‚Äì a new first-person puzzle game üëÅ<br>We can finally reveal the game we‚Äôve been working on and look forward to hearing what you think!

<h2 class="section-heading">Play Today!</h2>
<p>
We are happy to announce that you can play a demo version of <i>Spectacle</i> TODAY! We have been selected to show <i>Spectacle</i> alongside many other great puzzle games during the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/CerebralPuzzleShowcase">Cerebral Puzzle Showcase</a> presented by <a href="https://www.draknek.org/">Draknek & Friends</a>. </p>

<p>
The event runs from <b> May 23rd until May 30th</b>, don't miss it!
</p>

<div class="text-center"><iframe src="https://store.steampowered.com/widget/2996710/" frameborder="0" width="646" height="190"></iframe></div>

<p>
You get to play the tutorial sequence, and at the end, you will get a sneak peek of the ‚Äòfirst proper level‚Äô of the full game. Take control of Glo, a newly hatched lizard who learns about the world of Trip Space while you explore the surreal world of <i>Spectacle</i> and engage with its puzzles.

<span class="caption text-muted">An early concept of the main character, Glo.</span> 


<h2 class="section-heading">A new way to perceive puzzles</h2>

<p>
<i>Spectacle</i> offers a novel puzzle solving experience with unique mechanics and controls. The game began life as an exploration of tele-rotating the player in 3D space with a ‚Äúmatch cut‚Äù and continued to grow from there.  
</P>

<img class="img-fluid bordered" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/12/TeleRotate.gif" alt="Demo Image">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Same, same...</span> 

<p>
A lot has changed since then and I‚Äôm so happy to finally be sharing Spectacle publicly. I hope that players have as much fun playing it as we did making it. 
</P>

<h2 class="section-heading">Tell us what you think!</h2>

<p>
The HPY Discord is slowly growing. If you aren‚Äôt already a member of our little community, we would love to have you join and share your experiences with the <i>Spectacle</i> Demo. We are gearing up to announce something new soon and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/8TkpjHHVzZ">our Discord Server</a> is the best way to stay up to date. </P>

<p>
Games take a monumental amount of time and effort to develop, and releasing is a scary moment for any studio. The community response to the game is everything we hoped for and more, seeing players enjoy their time on Frog Island has been so rewarding for us, and hearing fun stories from friends and fans never gets old. We hope this is just the first of many Half Past Yellow adventures that fans enjoy.

<h2 class="section-heading">Patched up and ready to go</h2>

<p>
As of mid-November, our first bug-fixing patch for <i>Time on Frog Island</i> was released across all platforms. It took a while to make it onto consoles due to some logistical issues on our side, but everything is up and running now with everyone on the same version of the game. 
</P>

<p>
The patch fixes a few niggling bugs seen around the island, plus some bigger bugs associated with The Merchant and The Blacksmith schedules not being properly updated. We have also fixed a bug blocking some players from getting the Frogs Legs, Sea Legs, and Yeet trophies/achievements (sorry about that trophy hunters).

<h2 class="section-heading">Time on Frog Island OST now available!</h2>
<p>
It is now possible to take our cosy island vibes with you wherever you go! The <i>Time on Frog Island</i> soundtrack is now available for purchase on Steam. We don‚Äôt have a timeline yet, but we would like to bring the OST to other platforms (such as Spotify) as well. Let us know which ones you use! We will keep you posted on that progress. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is next for Half Past Yellow?</h2>

<p>
At Half Past Yellow, we are consistently curious about different genres and technology. We will always bring the same HPY charm and style to all of our games, but each project will be different to the one that came before. We are really excited for 2023, production has already begun on our next project and we can‚Äôt wait until we get to show it off. Until then you will just have to keep your eyes peeled! üëÅÔ∏è

<p>
A lot has happened since the last post on this regularly irregular blog so there's quite a few things to go over! First up, we have a new name: <b><i>Time on Frog Island</i></b>!
</p>

<div class="text-center">
  <video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/9/NameReveal.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">New year, new me!</span> 

<p>
</p>

<p>
We updated the name to make it easier to search for the game and not get swamped by financial and sports news. It's a little bittersweet since we grew quite fond of the name <i>Trading Time</i> and are sad to see it go. Other potential contenders were: <i>'Beyond the Pond'</i>, <i>'Gaffed Mast'</i>, <i>'Barter Buddies'</i>, <i>'Hey Yo, What's That Item? Can You Get It For Me?'</i> and many others! Did we make the right choice? Only (<s>Trading</s>) time (on Frog Island) will tell!
</P>

<h2 class="section-heading">New Trailer!</h2>

<p>
Next up, we released another trailer showcasing even more of the island and the various frog folk you'll encounter set to our own spin on a catchy, familiar tune:
</p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 rounded">
	<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0Ht_GsBVkE" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>
Did you spot the <i>secret crabs</i> littered around the island? There's one hidden in almost every shot. How many can you find? Let us know on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/8TkpjHHVzZ">Discord</a>!
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">New Release Date!</h2>
<p>
And now for the release date reveal, get your calendar marking pen ready and peep the announcement trailer below:
</p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 rounded">
	<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1a55zKKtnyY" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>
<i>Time on Frog Island</i> will release on <b>July 12th</b> for PC and all major consoles! Not only that - we're very excited to also have <i>ToFI</i> available as...
</p>

<h2>Physical Copies!</h2>

<p>
For the collectors amongst us, <i>Time on Frog Island</i> will also be available in physical editions for your favourite console! You might be able to find it in your local game shops but you can also preorder with our partners at Signature Edition games <a href="https://signatureeditiongames.com/search?type=product&options%5Bprefix%5D=last&q=time+on+frog+island">here</a>!

<h2 class="section-heading">Same Prologue!</h2>
<p>
For a limited time only as of this writing, we have not yet updated the title screen to <i>Time on Frog Island</i> in the Prologue on Steam! Invest in yourself and play the <b>free</b> Prologue now if you haven't already. Once it's updated, you'll be able to tell everyone "I played it when it was still called <i>Trading Time</i>!" and acrue a couple shiny <i>hipster points</i>! If you're reading this after we've updated it, then sadly you're too late! But for real we would still love it if you checked it out and also leave a review...

<h2 class="section-heading">Not long left!</h2>

<p>
<i>Phew</i>, big update! It's exciting times for us over at Half Past Yellow and we can't wait to have you all play our game! If you'd like to keep a closer eye on what we're up to or just say "Hi!", come join us and other fans over on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/8TkpjHHVzZ">Discord</a>!

Hi! My name is Mikkel! I‚Äôm a Marketing Intern here at Half Past Yellow on behalf of Copenhagen Business Academy in Denmark. I‚Äôm here until April! I‚Äôm natively Danish but speak fluent English.  
</p>

<p>
I‚Äôm hijacking the blog from Remy today! :D
</p>

<p>
First of all, welcome to all our new followers! We had a bit of a viral post last Wednesday and that sure does warm my little marketing heart! <3 If it‚Äôs your first time with us here, be sure to also check out the previous blog posts!

<p>
Although I could ramble about marketing and SoMe presence, that is not the topic of today.
</p>

<p>
Today I want to write a little about our process in a country that is generally shut down. As you may or may not know, our studio is based in Copenhagen and that Denmark has closed most public places due to COVID-19. This means that we have been working home. I want to share a little bit about what our working process looks like these days. 
</P>

<p>
Essentially, our office exists on a Discord server. An open virtual office environment as we call it. The way it works is that we have a meeting every morning, so we still have some daily structure. We then move on to our tasks and work by ourselves. The perk of using Discord is that we can have a call open, which gives us the option of just unmuting when we need to address something or have something off topic to say. It helps create a close to real office environment. There are also other channels we can pop off to for private conversations or meetings.
</P>

<p>
In a real office environment you‚Äôll also have small talk and banter. From what I can read from my peers online, a lot of companies face issues with not being able to recreate this in a virtual environment  This is especially challenging because it‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt really force. We chose to fight this problem by having different channels for different subjects. 
</P>

<span class="caption text-muted">Super secret dev channels!</span> 

<p>
We have #devrandom where we can post random stuff we find online, which often sparks spontaneous conversation. Of course it's not the same as being together in person, but it‚Äôs real close! 
</P>

<p>
These channels are private to us Developers, but our Discord server is public for anyone who wants to be part of our community! You can <a href="https://discord.com/invite/8TkpjHHVzZ">join us here</a>! We really enjoy hearing about any feedback and thoughts you might have about us or our games, so don‚Äôt be shy! You‚Äôll also know about the occasional scoop that we don‚Äôt post anywhere else...

Strap in, everybody - we're very excited to finally start revealing more about the totally-normal native islander society of our game! Yeah no, "normal" probably isn't the right word... Regardless, as it so happens, the island that our Sailor has shipwrecked on is inhabited by a small town of large humanoid frogs! üßçüê∏! 
 Let's start with introducing The Carpenter!
</p>

<p>
The Carpenter is tasked with creating and maintaining all the wooden structures on the island. Being the only real handyfrog available, he is always busy. Unfortunately, he is also constantly falling behind on his tasks by always misplacing the exact tool needed for the job. He could definitely use a helping hand to find them so you better keep an eye out as you explore the island!
</p>

</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">He's just big-boned.</span> 

<p>
</p>

<p>
Why frogs, you ask? Well, we needed some island natives and asked ourselves, "What if humans stemmed from frogs instead of apes and were left alone on an island all to themselves?" Naturally, this is it. You're looking at the first character of many in the only possible outcome of our highly scientific research and plentiful discussions on the matter.
</p>

<p>
Today we are presenting The Carpenter but we'll be showcasing the other townsfolk over the next couple posts, so make sure you stay up-to-date and follow what we're up to on the <a href="#social"> platforms below</a>!
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Early Concept Art</h2>
<p>The Carpenter can be considered one of the simpler characters in our cast of villagers and we wanted his visual design to reflect that. Dressed in a plain vest and undersized beanie, his glassy-eyed expression almost never changes no matter the circumstance.

</div>

<h2 class="section-heading">Have you seen my tool?</h2>

<p>
Don't let his blank gaze fool you, however! He's a master craftsman that can build almost anything and will certainly prove it to you! Just.. ah...
</p>

  <video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/6/searching.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Why is it always in the last place you look?</span> 

<p> Well... He's gone and lost his tool again! Maybe we can help him find it? Oh! Is that it?
</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/6/what_is_it.gif" alt="Demo Image">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">Woah! What's that tool?!</span> 

<p>
It's a saw! Of course it is! Obviously you can't be a carpenter without it. Good job, everyone! Clearly, the nature of a blog means that this is almost as far from the actual gameplay as is possible but the sense of accomplishment and helpfulness is almost just as real. Trust me, though, when I say it won't always be quite so easy to find what you need strewn about the island... 
</p>

</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Working hard or hardly working, am I right?!</span> 

<p>
Now that he's got his saw back he can get to work! Let's leave him to it and check back later. Maybe some other townsfolk could use some help in the meantime? Make sure to connect with us below to be the first to find out who else is around!

Up until now you've seen bright and sunny images of our island but what if we told you there was another side to it? Let there be... Night! 
</p>

<p>A core feature of our game is a day/night cycle that has different gameplay opportunities depending on the time of day. Not only was it important to us to have each time of day to look and feel distinct from the others, they needed to also transition nicely from one to the next. Oh, and also you need to be able to see what you're doing when it's dark.</P>

<div class="text-center">
  <video class="video-fluid bordered" autoplay loop controls muted src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/4/full_cycle.mp4" type ="video/mp4"></>
</div> 
<span class="caption text-muted">Hello darkness my old friend...</span> 

<p>
During normal gameplay each distinct time of day in the game lasts several minutes - so don't worry, there's plenty of time to explore and get things done while it's still light out!
</P>

<p>
What we're essentially doing is defining specific times of day and setting it up for the look we want. Then during gameplay we interpolate between the current phase's settings and the next one based on the time in-game. We have split the day into six phases: Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Dusk, Night, and Late Night. In our case, Late Night is indefinite and doesn't need to transition into Morning otherwise it would probably make sense to also have a Dawn phase.
</p>

<p>
The settings we are defining to provide the biggest visual impact between the phases are:
<ul>
  <li> The Sun Light
  <ul>
	<li>Color
	<li>Direction
  </ul>
  <li> Fog
  <ul>
	<li>Color
	<li>Density
  </ul>
  <li> Post Processing
  <ul>
	<li> Color Correction
	<li> Vignette
  </ul>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img class="img-fluid bordered" src="https://halfpastyellow.com/blog/img/posts/4/all_tod.png" alt="Demo Image">
</div>
<span class="caption text-muted">The difference is like night and day!</span> 


<p>
As you can see, some settings change quite significantly from one phase to the next but it doesn't feel quite so drastic in-game since the gradual interpolation handles it all for us very nicely. Night time clearly stands out over the rest, and that's certainly intentional seeing as most of the time players will be out during the day and taking nightfall as a signal to rest and prepare for the next day.
</p>

<p>
That's all, folks! It's a bit of a short post this time around since there's not much more to say and the images pretty much speak for themselves. It's probably worth mentioning that configuring every setting for each phase can be very time consuming and we've spent many hours (and will probably continue spending many more!) making small adjustments here and there to ensure that everything looks right no matter the time.
</p>

<p>As always, if you have any specific questions or comments about any of this, just pop on in to our Discord server and we'll be more than happy to oblige! With that, I'll leave you with a bonus clip of a very important night time activity. Good night!
